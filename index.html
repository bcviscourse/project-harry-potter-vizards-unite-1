						<br>Interest in the cryptocurrency market has exploded, from programmers
						looking to partake in open-source development, to 
							both amateur and institutional investors looking for new investments.
						<br>
						<br>This graph shows the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies since inception to today. 
							In the world of crypto, market cap is a metric used to determine the relative value of a
							coin.

						In part, irrationality and unrealistic expectations led to the formation of the speculative crypto bubble.
						Many prominent economists and investors warned against this unprecedented increase in prices.
	
						<br><br>
						Over the course of 2018, ~80% of market value was erased from its peak, 
						giving rise to the period that is known today as the <font size = '6' color="#add8e6">Crypto Winter</font>.

				In conclusion, we have taken two approaches to studying cryptocurrency trends.	
				We have taken an engineering approach and examined the years in which various hashing algorithms have been used using our scatter chart.
				
				We have also taken a financial approach using the treemap as we examined which hashing algorithm is associated with the greatest market cap.
