						<br>Interest in the cryptocurrency market has exploded in the past decade, with programmers
						looking to partake in open-source development and 
						investors, both amateur and institutional, looking for new investments.

						<br>This graph shows the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies since the inception of Bitcoin
						in 2009 to today.

					<br> In conclusion, we have taken two approaches to studying cryptocurrency trends.
						
						We have taken an engineering approach and examined the years in which various hashing algorithms have been used using our scatter chart.
						
						We have also taken a financial approach using the treemap as we examined which hashing algorithm is associated with the greatest market cap.
