				A <font size = '6' color="#3f3f3f">cryptocurrency</font> is a digital currency in which users can send or receive payments through a network of participants
				around the world. These transactions are secured by cryptographic protocols and are often supported by
				blockchain / ledger technologies. Many cryptocurrencies support open-source development, in an effort
				to be more transparent and foster innovation from programmers and creators around the world.
				In general, they aspire to have the following key characteristics:

				In conclusion, we have examined three factors fundamental to understanding cryptocurrencies: 
				<br>
				(i) network inception, (ii) consensus algorithm, and (iii) market capitalization.
				<br><br>
				There are hundreds of factors unique to digital currencies that developers and investors alike
				are analyzing to evaluate a crypto's quality as a technology and investment. This only scratches 
				the surface to understanding the complexities of cryptocurrencies, which have the potential to 
				transform the technology and financial sectors of the world.
