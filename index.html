						<br> This is a line graph showing the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies in millions of dollars starting from 2009 and ending with November, 2019. 
						There is an observable spike in total market cap between 2017 and 2018. We will write more about this in our final version.
						<br>
						<br>

						<br> 
						<br> One bubble appears representing all coins.
						This representation is meant to convey that all cryptocurrencies have essentially the same goal: to secure transactions using cryptography.
						
						The bubble will pop, splitting into circles representing different cryptocurrencies.
						We will next take an engineering approach to studying cryptocurrency and consider
						the years in which various hashing algorithms have been used.

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br> 
						<br> Circles representing about 20 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are arranged by year of creation. The bubbles will change color to show different hashing algorithms.
					</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Section 3 -->
				<section>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='3'>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br> Circles have changed color based on hash algorithm. The bubbles will grow in size to represent relative market cap.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='4'>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br> 
						<br> Circles have grown or shrunk. The colors will turn neutral. The colors turn neutral to show the shift from an engineering approach to a financial one. 
						We will next examine which algorithm has produced the greatest market cap for cryptocurrencies.

					<br>
					<br> In conclusion, we have taken two approaches to studying cryptocurrency trends.
						
						We have taken an engineering approach and examined the years in which various hashing algorithms have been used using our scatter chart.
						
						We have also taken a financial approach using the treemap as we examined which hashing algorithm is associated with the greatest market cap.
